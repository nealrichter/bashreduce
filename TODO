Suggestions:

 - auto-detect version of netcat?
    - nc.traditional -h
    - nc.openbsd -h

- pipe stderr from mappers and reducers to
    - br_stderr_reducer_$RANDOM
    - br_stderr_mapper_$RANDOM

- Allow hadoop streaming utilization of stderr counters?
    - reporter:counter:<group>,<counter>,<amount> should be sent to stderr to update the counter.
    - then send all of these through sort | reducer to sum the counters

- Universal cat command
    - added a C implementation that can automatically handle txt,gzip,bzip2,lzma etc
    - probably easy to write a shell script as well
